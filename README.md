# Introduction

This readme is for the internship project. We will deposit all the information in this repository. 

# Folder hierarchy

This step is important. So we need to decided int the first place. Please place everything to their respective folders.  

We have a data folder but probably we will not push any data to github. If we can download data, then please write a script to download it. We will push data *only if* we have to.

+ data
    + if we can download data, then please 
+ codes
+ results
    + tables
    + plots
    + models
+ report
    + tables
    + figures
    + dotfiles
    + reference.bib
    + codes (to reproduce figures)

Let's follow these guideline.

# Overview of the project

Authentication of ancient DNA reads can be done using alignment based methods. However, it is not possible to align most of the aDNA sequences to reference genome. So, most of the aDNA sequences remain unauthenticated.

In this project, we would like to tackle this problem via usint the frequency difference of *k*-length nucleotide substrings (*k*-mers) between modern and ancient DNA sequences.

# Material and Methods

## Tools

### Gargammel

We will use this tool to simulate modern and ancient DNA sequences. It is possible to download this tool using this [site](https://grenaud.github.io/gargammet/).

### Mapdamage2

This [site](https://ginolhac.github.io/mapDamage/).
